# Calculate payment with overtime

## Problem Description
You have already completed an program (in the practice) to calculate a person's weekly pay. However, that assignment did not include any overtime pay. In this assignment, you will account for overtime.
* Your function should be named `pay_calculator` and should accept 1 argument (the hours worked).

* The hourly wage is 16.50 per hour for the first 40 hours.
* Overtime pay is "time and a half" - in other words, the hourly amount plus an additional 50%.

### Example
```
Hours worked? 40
660

Hours worked? 50
907.50
```

### Suggested Approach
1) Work out the logic *before* you start typing.
2) Be sure to test different conditions (less than 40 hours worked, 40 hours worked, more than 40 hours worked). Your program should work for all of them.

### Submitting your assignment
* First, test your program by running it a few times. Does it work correctly? Check the formatting - is everything formatted nicely?
* When you are ready, commit and push to GitHub.
* Check the Pull Requests for feedback on code function and style. Fix any issues, then commit and push again. Repeat until no issues are found.
* When done, submit "done" on Canvas.
